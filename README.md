# Morse Code Python Audio Translator
This project is a simple Python tool that converts any text or word into Morse code and generates an audio file (output.wav) with the corresponding beeps.

## Features
* Converts text into international Morse code.
* Generates a WAV file with short (dot) and long (dash) beeps.
* Adjustable tone frequency and timing (dot, dash, gaps).
* Works offline and cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS).

```bash
Enter a word: SOS

Output:
Morse code: ... --- ...
Audio saved to output.wav
```

The program will play the Morse code as short and long beeps.
